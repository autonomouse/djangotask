This task is written in python3 using django version 1.8.7

While the task documentation requested the use of VirtualEnv and for it to be run using pip install, which can be done via:

$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

However, it also uses npm. These have been pre-installed into the node_modules folder, but both of the above tasks should be doable by running the followng command:

$ ./do.py install

To load up test fixtures, run the required migrations, etc and fire up runserver in one line, please use:

$ ./do.py dev

N.B. The do.py file only assumes that you have python3 already installed and ar eusing an apt based system, such as Ubuntu.
