Install dependencies by running the followng command:

$ ./do.py install

Load up test fixtures, run the required migrations, etc and fire up runserver using:

$ ./do.py dev

N.B. This assumes you have python3 already installed.

Sorry, I know I'm supposed to use VirtualEnv and run using pip install, but didn't see this requirement until the end. I'm used to running things in a system container (i.e. LXC/LXD) and it was beaten into me at Canonical that apt >>> pip and to never use pip if it can be avoided. 

I can add this later on if you like, but I figured you'd like to have the code sooner rather than later.

If using the included db.sqlite3 database, the defualt DB credentials are admin/password123 (If you've deleted that and are starting from scratch, you will have to run python3 manage.py createsuperuser)
